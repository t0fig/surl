SURL is a URL shortener written in Golang and ReactJs. I did it as a personal project.

Initially, I did this project with docker-compose deployment. You can find it in the surl_docker_compose folder and try it locally.
Later on, to deploy it on my Kubernetes cluster, I wrote the necessary manifests and modified the project code a bit where needed. The modified version and manifests are in the surl_k8s folder.
